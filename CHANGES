v0.6.3 - 04/15/2017

STATE FILE COMPATIBILITY - v0.5.2 and greater

* Updated Serialization format to JSON.  Loading legacy state files is still supported for now, however, all new state files will be saved to the new format. Additionally, the results of a run are now exported as well in the RunResultForRoleID field of the saved json state. 

NOTE: For RunResultForRoleID in the JSON state file, the key of the array matches the RoleID and the value is a boolean indicating true (green) or false (red or blue).

* New right-click context options for sending cookies to users. Sends both current cookies and cookies set in the message's reponse.

* Fixed bug in chaining where content-length wouldn't update appropriately

* Added randomness generation.  Set the string #{AUTHMATRIX:RANDOM} anywhere in the original message's header or body and the run will replace it with a random 4 char numeric string. Most common use case is for APIs that reject requests that are identical to a previous request.

v0.6.0 - MAJOR UPDATE - 10/11/2016

STATE FILE COMPATIBILITY - v0.5.2 and greater

* Chains:
 - New advanced configuration table for chaining several messages together
 - Can be used for Advanced CSRF Token handling or propagating IDs/GUIDs to later messages
 - See README for instructions and examples

* Added Drag-and-Drop Reorder for Requests in Message Table:
 - Required to support Chains

* New Columns in User and Message Table:
 - Separate columns for cookies, headers, and POST args for clarity
 - Supports use-case where user requires both a header and cookies
 - Both tables now use index identifier instead of row number

* Update Color Scheme:
 - Blue for False Positive and purple for Failure Regex
 - Colored highlighting of selected rows

* Allow Editing base requests from AuthMatrix
 - Only works when the message has been altered with a keyboard (i.e. not "Change request method" or "Change body encoding")
 - https://support.portswigger.net/customer/en/portal/questions/16705314-imessageeditor-ismessagemodified-does-not-detect-modification

* Change Target Domain:
 - You can now right click selected messages and change the target domain/port/tls configuration

* Bug Fixes:
 - no longer sends each base request on Load State
 - correctly times out during Run when host is unreachable
 - handle empty session tokens correctly
 - check if the HTTP Response is empty in checkResults() and handle appropriately 
 - run messages in order by row number, not by index
 - when deleting items, decrement row if the row is affected by the change, not the index


v0.5.4 - 09/26/2016

v0.5.2 - 04/13/2016

STATE FILE COMPATIBILITY - v0.5.2 and greater

* MAJOR BUG FIX: Issue when adding new roles after messages have already been sent to AuthMatrix.  Could lead to invalid results and incorrect UI display of the Message table's checkboxes. Invalidates some previous saved states.  
* Re-enabled "Send from Target Map Tree" when the selected messages all have responses
* Refactored runMessage code and added support for multiple cookies in the session tokens

v0.5.1 - 03/21/2016
